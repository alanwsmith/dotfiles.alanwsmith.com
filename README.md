These are my dotfiles

I'm just getting started moving things into this 
repo. I'll add details as things progress


## iTerm2 Themes

- These are all darkish themes
- I went through all the themes from <a href="https://iterm2colorschemes.com/">iterm2colorschemes.com/</a> and pulled out all the dark ones I liked
- Ended up writing a script to help with the process (TODO: Link post: 2fscvzjocy1g)
- Every time I open a new tab a random one is pulled via `iterm2-autolaunch-scripts/_new_tab_random_color_theme/_new_tab_random_color_theme.py`
